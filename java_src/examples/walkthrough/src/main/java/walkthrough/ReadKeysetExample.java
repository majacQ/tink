   * Deserializes a JSON serialized encrypted keyset {@code serializedKeyset}; the keyset is assumed

   * <p>Prerequisites for this example:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Register AEAD implementations of Tink.
   *   <li>Create a key encryption AEAD primitive. This is usually a remote AEAD provided by a Key
   *       Management Service (KMS).
   *   <li>Create a keyset and serialize it encrypted using the key encryption AEAD.
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param associatedData the associated data to use for decrypting the keyset. See
   *     https://developers.google.com/tink/aead#associated_data.
   * @return the serialized keyset.
