/**
 * The Prf interface is an abstraction for an element of a pseudo random function family, selected
 * by a key.
 *
 * <p>It has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It is deterministic: {@link #compute(input, outputLength)} will always return the same
 *       output if the same key is used. {@code compute(input, length1)} will be a prefix of {@code
 *       compute(input, length2)} if {@code length1 < length2} and the same key is used.
 *   <li>It is indistinguishable from a random function: Given the evaluation of n different inputs,
 *       an attacker cannot distinguish between the PRF and random bytes on an input different from
 *       the n that are known.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Use cases for PRF are deterministic redaction of PII, keyed hash functions, creating sub IDs
 * that do not allow joining with the original dataset without knowing the key. While PRFs can be
 * used in order to prove authenticity of a message, using the MAC interface is recommended for that
 * use case, as it has support for verification, avoiding the security problems that often happen
 * during verification. It also allows for non-deterministic MAC algorithms.
